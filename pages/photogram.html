                    <p>2D photography has three problems that are deeply integrated into the fabric of society.</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Distance from memories: 2D photography is limited. A picture doesn’t fully represent a memory because
                            a memory is dynamic. Environment, movement, feeling, and changing emotions, are all key aspects
                            of a memory that a picture can’t capture. </li>
                        <li>Distance from the truth: Fake news! Social media and 2D photos obscure reality. We must look towards
                            more accurate methods of capturing moments in time in order to have an accurate understanding
                            for the world around us. </li>
                        <li>Distance from the friends: Photoshop and related tools further create inaccurate representations
                            of the world around us. </li>

                    <p>Currently, media isn’t associated to the location that it’s created in. Sure, we can see a pin on a map
                        for where we took a picture on a smartphone, but we need to fully feel the environment to get a real
                        understanding of the media’s context. </p>

            <p>When researching and testing interaction techniques, we drew inspiration from camera mode dials, hollywood clapperboards,
                and photogrammetry methods. It’s important to incorporate familiar icons and and interactions when creating
                an entirely new way of looking at something that people do every day, in this case, photography. Doing so
                makes it easier for people to understand and adopt the product. For example, when the iPhone launched, the
                icons used for the phone, contacts, and mail were 2D representations of the products people already knew.
                It doesn’t matter that a land line phone isn’t the most common way to call people, having it as the icon
                for a phone made it easier for people to integrate the iPhone into their daily lifestyle. As such, we opted
                for a camera dial interaction as are our menu.</p>

            <p>Before organizing and placing the various menu within the app, we started broad and created a multitude of icons
                with different images. Our first step was to figure out which icons represented their intended feature best
                through user research, surveying, and testing. </p>

            <p>As we started to prototype the camera dial for our menu, we realized that it didn't make sense for 2D icons to
                be overlayed onto a 3D dial. Despite traditional camera dials following this pattern, the 3D nature of an
                AR environment enabled us to make our icons more dynamic and engaging. As such, we moved in the direction
                of using 3D icons. </p>
