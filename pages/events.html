                  messaging. You have the freedom to communicate what you want, when you want, and to multiple people at once.
                  Group messages, however, are an archive of thoughts, and are not optimized for finding a mutual time to get
                  together. Alternate scheduling services such as WhenIsGood or Doodle are useful for meetings and interviews, but feel out of place in a social context.

               <p>Pew Research Center reported that 42% of smartphone owners ages 18 to 29 uses general
                 messaging apps such as WhatsApp, iMessage, Kik or Messenger. As such, I chose to focus on
                 people aged 15 to 30 as the demographic. There is a steady increase in the use of mobile group chats worldwide.
                   This chart displays users of any age who use a messaging
                   app via mobile phone at least once per month. By 2018, eMarketer
                   predicts that the number of chat app users worldwide will represent 80% of smartphone users.</p>

         <h3><b>Constraints</b></h3>
         <p>Creating an app that lives within the
            context of a Messages conversation introduces unique design constraints. I had to work around the lack of
            screen real estate and think about the existing visual elements that users expect to see within iMessage.
            iMessage apps are typically used in the context of fast-paced, informal conversations. As such, keeping the
            number of interaction steps as low as possible ensures that the organic flow of messaging is not lost.
         </p>
      </article>
      <article class="section1 animated">
         <h3><b>Interactions</b></h3>
         <p>The first challenge was creating a simple, minimal
            interface for the calendar’s integration into the app. If we’re trying to figure out when people are
            available, we must look at hours, days, weeks, and maybe even the month to get an accurate picture of one’s
            schedule. I decided to use a “painting” touch gesture so that users can easily “paint” their availability on
            the calendar. This is a visual representation of the organic, fluid flow that is necessary for an unobtrusive
            iMessage app. Also, people may be familiar with this gesture from the most popular scheduling apps, which
            makes it simpler for users to feel comfortable with the app’s flow. Though it is sometime necessary to create
            custom controls, using a pre-established interaction is favorable in this case as the unique value in this
            app does not lie in the calendar by itself.

      <article class="section1 animated">
         <p>I used a step-by-step flow for the availability and event creation in order to keep things simple. </p>
         <ul>
            <li>Will the inviter’s view look different than the invitee’s view? (only where necessary). </li>
            <li>Should people “paint” when they are available, or when they are busy? (Available).</li>
            <li>Will overlaying existing calendar events (iCal) feel out of place for a casual, friends-based event app? (No, it’s important to see all obligations to have an accurate schedule). </li>
            <li>How should people’s responses be visually differentiated? (Stacked opacities of different colors).</li>
            <li>Should we display the hours before or after the event is created? (Before, as the time of day is important for any get together). </li>
         </ul>
      </article>
      <article class="section1 animated">
         <p>Once the “inviter” sends his/her availability, the event is created. Now, all participants have the option of adding integrations to the event. Though I experimented with multiple 3rd party integrations that make sense for events, I narrowed it down to the following 4 for simplicity and clarity:</p>
         <ol>
            <li>Photos: Create and be automatically subscribed to a shared album with iCloud Photo Sharing.</li>
            <li>Maps: Suggest and vote for the eventʼs location with Maps.</li>
            <li>Music: Add a shared Apple Music playlist through MusicKit with your friendsʼ preferences in the mix.</li>
            <li>Pay: Send or receive money from individuals through Apple Pay in iOS 11.</li>

         <ul>
            <li><b>Respect the platform that you're designing for.</b> It's important to understand the user's expectations and use established interaction patterns in order to design an experience that can live within the context of a Messages conversation. </li>
            <li><b>Provide focused content.</b> Messaging extensions should have a single focus. For example, there are countless potential integrations for an events app such as music playlists, payment services, social media, reminders, etc. However, for clarity and ease of use, such integrations should either be optional, limited, or eliminated all together. This is an area of the app I could definitely improve upon through additional user research. </li>
