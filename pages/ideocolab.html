         <p>In October 2017, I had the pleasure of being one of 60 designers, entrepreneurs, researchers, and makers selected from 700+ applicants for IDEO CoLab’s makeathon in San Francisco. In this workshop, we were put into multidisciplinary teams to go through the IDEO design process and envision human-centered applications using blockchain or AI. </p>

         <p>At the beginning of day, I was placed into a multidisciplinary team of talented and diverse makers. My amazing teammates and I were assigned to work with AI and information filters.</p>

               <p>Our team’s prompt was to enable an AI to filter the digital world. Since no one in our team had prior experience with AI, it was important for us to spend time defining what an AI Co-Pilot does and what problems currently exist. We started by writing down anything related to AI, digital content, filters, and the ways in which such concepts affect human life.</p>

               <p>IDEO CoLab provided structured design frameworks that allowed our team to effectively communicate our ideas and dive deep into our brief. Once our team had a whiteboard of ideas relating to digital filters, we each created a journey map of the user for one of the ideas. This framework allowed us to identify and strategize for key moments in the experience each of us was designing. </p>

            <div class="col-md-12">
               <p>Through our brainstorming session, we identified several problem areas where we could integrate a digital filter. In order to condense such areas into specific use cases, we framed each insight statement as a "How Might We (HMW)" question in order to generate possible solutions. For example, "HMW help parents monitor their children's online activity?" or "HMW enable people to view the world from someone else's perspective" or "HMW allow marketers to step into the shoes of their audience?"</p>

            <div class="col-md-12">
               <p>We did additional research, received feedback from CoLab engineers, and continuously reevaluated our ideas. True to IDEO's design thinking methodology, each team member brought their best ideas to the table and we supported and built upon each one. </p>
               <p>My team ended up with two ideas we were interested in prototyping:</p>
               <ol>
                  <li>An interface for parents to monitor their children's online activity without limiting their curious nature. The connotation of "parental restriction" is negative. In talking about values and family dynamics, our team discussed how family values are the first form of bias introduced to a person. This filter would enable children to consume content that aligns with their family's values as well as content that encourages them to form their own ideologies. The AI would enable the parental controls to evolve as the child does.</li>
                  <li>A Google Chrome Extension that allows people to search the internet from a different perspective. This extension would encourage marketers to search the internet through the lense of their audience, people to uncover the differences in advertisements and suggestions based on different personas, and people to gain awareness about those outside their "bubble."</li>
               </ol>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-12">
               <p>Though the idea of creating a new system for parental control was intriguing, our team agreed that we would need more time to flesh out the concept. We decided to create Empath, a Google Chrome Extension that allows internet searchers search through the lense of another persona.</p>

               <p>With an hour and a half to go, we were anxious to start prototyping Empath. Since building a functional AI is a time-intensive process, our own intelligence was a good stand-in for prototyping purposes.
               </p>
               <p>The prototyping process began around a simple and fast demonstration, which aimed to communicate a basic use case for Empath. Our first user story was a 12-year-old boy named Jake who wants to buy a gift for his crush, a 12-year-old girl at school. He uses Empath to search the web as a 12-year-old girl to learn about the trends and suggested products for her persona. We printed out the search results for "gifts" from both the boy and girl's perspective and illustrated the differences to people. We gained valuable insight from this simple and rough demonstration, which informed our next steps.</p>

         <p>In just one day, I learned an incredible amount about making prototypes to pose and answer questions about a problem, facilitating discussion with teammates of different backgrounds, and embracing ambiguity. The makeathon was a fantastic experience and I am excited to join the subset of makeathon participants selected for a full-time fellowship with IDEO CoLab in January 2017! </p>
